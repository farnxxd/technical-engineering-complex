A compact app about technical & engineering faculty NOW IN YOUR HANDS! ü§≥üèª You can [download it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ZPhwbUUhDqT15eyfzy-j_Am9IwY74TY/view?usp=drive_link).

# Description

Come and join me in experiencing my recently created product, an Android application about the faculty I studied for three years and a half at this place. This app is built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Also it follows Android best practices and design patterns suggested by Google and Android developers documents. The intention behind this app is to provide useful information for students studying a field available in technical & engineering faculty.

# Features

You can explore the history of faculty and see how many classes and sites are available. Also there is a screen dedicated to every education group which you can check out the dean of faculty, academic members and corresponding education authorities. If necessary, you could make a call to education unit or send email to dean of faculty. Don't worry about contact info, It's all in there! Even if you are not from Rasht, I got your back! You can access location of university and if you need directions, Google map is there to help you!

Attention: This app is only available in Farsi/Persian language.

# Extra Note
This is the capstone of my bachelor degree which I was supposed to show a summary of facilities and all employees including deans and authorities of the faculty. I'm also glad that I had a chance to put it all in practice whatever I was focusing on during past couple of months. There's no doubt this is a simple project but this was an opportunity to test my knowledge and skills as a rookie.

If there are any mistakes in my codes, you are welcome to share them here with me. I‚Äôll take notes.
